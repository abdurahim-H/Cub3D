## üó∫Ô∏è Map Configuration

Maps use the `.cub` extension with the following format:

```
R 1920 1080           # Resolution
NO ./path_to_north.xpm # North texture
SO ./path_to_south.xpm # South texture
WE ./path_to_west.xpm  # West texture 
EA ./path_to_east.xpm  # East texture
S ./path_to_sprite.xpm # Sprite texture
F 220,100,0           # Floor color (RGB)
C 225,30,0            # Ceiling color (RGB)

# Map (1=wall, 0=floor, 2=sprite, N/S/E/W=player start position and direction)
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

```

## üßÆ Core Algorithm

The ray-casting algorithm works by:

1. Casting rays from the player's position
2. Using DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) to find wall intersections
3. Calculating perpendicular distance to avoid fisheye effect
4. Determining wall height based on distance
5. Applying textures based on wall orientation and hit position
6. Rendering sprites from farthest to nearest using a Z-buffer

## üíª Development Journey

This project started as an exploration of fundamental 3D rendering techniques that don't rely on hardware acceleration. The decision to focus on raycasting connects us with the roots of 3D game development while enforcing optimization principles and spatial reasoning that remain relevant in modern graphics programming.

Key development challenges included:
- Implementing accurate collision detection
- Managing performance with dynamic texture loading
- Creating intuitive depth perception without shader access
- Building an extensible architecture that supports further features
